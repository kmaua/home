                <p class="content-paragraph">My name is Kelson Maua. I was born in Sioux Lookout and raised in Dryden, Ontario, and moved to Thunder Bay for school in 2017. Originally I attended Lakehead University, where I studied Computer Science. About halfway through my first year I decided to transfer over to Confederation College to study Interactive Media Design. The more hands-on approach, along with the more media-focused content really drew me to the college, and to my program. I really enjoy learning by doing, rather than learning by listening! </p>
                <p class="content-paragraph">I am currently in the second semester of first year, and I have been a tutor for my Interactive Design Development and Web Design Development classes since October! I love working with anything media related, and my ultimate goal is to land a career in my field that makes me happy and allows me to do what I love!</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3 class="content-title">What do I do?</h3>
                <p class="content-subtitle">Why would you want me on your team?</p>
                <p class="content-paragraph">I may not be the most experienced, but I am passionate about what I do, I'm a quick learner, and I'm eager to get started in my field! As previously mentioned I am currently in school, so my skills will always be rapidly improving as I learn new things! I am currently learning/furthering my skills in Adobe Animate, Javascript, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Premiere Pro, and Audition.</p>
                <p class="content-paragraph">In High School I learned to program in C, and in my first year of University I learned more C and a little bit of C++. In College I have been learning to program in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also work with the CreateJS library and the Bootstrap framework. I created this website to host my portfolio and showcase some of my web design skills! Two birds with one stone!</p>
                <p class="content-paragraph">I enjoy anything to do with creating media, whether it be creating websites, taking and editing photos, graphic design, and any other projects I can get my hands on! I will admit, I can be shy at first. I am, however, very good at matching energy, and once I get comfortable I'm a super friendly, personable guy! I work well with clients, and I am good at taking criticism and instruction. In any of my past jobs I have never had an issue with an employer or co-worker, and I fully intend on keeping up that streak!</p>

                    <h3 class="content-title">My Education Background</h3>
                    <p class="content-subtitle">How did I get to where I am?</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">In High School I took as many art, communications technology, and programming classes as I possibly could. These classes sparked my interest in my field, and provided me with a ton of fantastic skills. The art classes I took were fantastic because they gave me a lot of creative freedom. I was able to work with my medium of choice, and I was graded as an individual. I think being able to stretch your creative muscles is extremely important!</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Communications Technology sparked my interest in photography and media in general. We worked a lot with cameras, but also learned software such as Photoshop, Excel, and Google Docs. We were also given a lot of freedom in these classes, often going outside and being able to roam free while taking photos!</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">I took a total of 5 programming classes throughout grades 10 - 12, and loved every minute of it. My teacher, Spuro Sourtzis, made the classes a truly enjoyable experience. He always played a variety of music in class, and everyone was able to move at their own pace depending on how quickly they grasped the concepts. This made for a classroom dynamic that didn't even feel like a class, and instead felt like I was just going to hang out with some friends and learn how to program! These classes taught me to program in C, and later on, started to delve into HTML and CSS! This not only taught me these languages, but also made it a lot easier for me to pick up other programming languages a lot easier! Learning Javascript in College was a breeze after already having that foundation of logic.</p>
